# this is a template file for creating a scenario file to drive a client test.
#
#	A scenerio describes what query set to use (queries and expected results) and which vdb to use to execute
#	the queries against.

#	The scenario.properties file is required, but any property can also be passed in as a System property or in the
#	config properties file.  Also, the scenario.properties override System properties and config properties.
#
#  NOTE:  These properties are used to substitute in the config properties files (see default = ctc-test-properties)
#			so that each scenario is able to drive its test case.

#
#	To define a scenario file:
#
#----------------------------
#	Properties:
#
#	-	queryset.dirname	-	name of the directory, under the QUERYSETDIR location, that represents a query set (queries and expected results)
#	-	test.queries.dirname	-	must be a name of the subdirectory under the queryset.dir that contains the test query.
#	-	expected.results.dirname	-	must be the name of the subdirectory under the queryset.dir that contains all the related 
#									expected result files to use to validate the test_queries against.
#
#	NOTE: There maybe multiple expected_results directories (by different names of course) sometimes depending on the datasources
#			that are being used by the vdb.  Therefore, the expected_results.dir is specified so that a different set of 
#			expected results can be specified for the same query set.
# 
#	4.	vdb.name	-	is the vdb to use for this scenario, this is substituted into the jdbc url at execution time.
#
#
#----------------------------

queryset.dirname=<queries_folder>

test.queries.dirname=test_queries
expected.results.dirname=expected_results

vdb.name=<vdbname>

# specify the username/password to use on the jdbc url in the ctc-test.properties
# for the specific scenario
#username=user
#password=user
